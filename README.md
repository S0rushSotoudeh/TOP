# Team Orienteering Problem Solver using POMO
This project implements the solution for the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) using the Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima (POMO) approach, 
as described in the paper by Kwon et al. (2020). The implementation is based on the code provided in the POMO repository.
